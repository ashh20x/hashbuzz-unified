# Legacy Cleanup Removal - Event-Based Edge Case Handling

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Related Issues:** Startup performance, Event-based architecture compliance

---

## Overview

Removed legacy startup cleanup code that directly processed stuck campaigns during server initialization. All edge cases and stuck campaign handling are now exclusively managed through the **event-based monitoring system** to ensure proper:

- ✅ Event flow integrity with idempotency guarantees
- ✅ Consistent error handling and logging
- ✅ Audit trail through campaign logs
- ✅ No race conditions with BullMQ workers
- ✅ Faster server startup times

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **src/index.ts** - Removed Startup Cleanup

**Before:**
```typescript
// One-time cleanup for legacy campaigns that might be stuck
try {
  const { completeCampaignOperation } = await import('@services/campaign-service');
  const prisma = await createPrismaClient();
  const now = new Date();

  const stuckCampaigns = await prisma.campaign_twittercard.findMany({
    where: {
      OR: [
        {
          card_status: 'CampaignRunning' as any,
          campaign_close_time: { lt: now },
        },
        {
          card_status: 'RewardDistributionInProgress' as any,
          campaign_expiry: { lt: now },
        },
      ],
    },
  });

  if (stuckCampaigns.length > 0) {
    logInfo(`Found ${stuckCampaigns.length} stuck campaigns, processing...`);
    for (const campaign of stuckCampaigns) {
      try {
        await completeCampaignOperation(campaign);
        logInfo(`✅ Processed stuck campaign: ${campaign.id}`);
      } catch (error) {
        logError(`❌ Failed to process campaign ${campaign.id}`, error);
      }
    }
  }
} catch (error) {
  logError('Error during legacy campaign cleanup', error);
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// NOTE: Stuck campaigns and edge cases are handled through the event-based monitoring system.
// Use the monitoring API endpoints:
// - GET /api/v201/monitoring/campaigns/stuck - View stuck campaigns
// - POST /api/v201/monitoring/campaigns/stuck/process - Process stuck campaigns
// This ensures all campaign operations go through the proper event flow with idempotency guarantees.
```

**Impact:**
- ⚡ Faster server startup (no database queries during init)
- 🔒 No risk of race conditions with BullMQ workers
- 📝 All processing now creates proper audit logs
- 🔄 Idempotency checks apply to all campaign processing

---

### 2. **src/V201/Modules/monitoring/controllers/MonitoringController.ts** - Enhanced Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation to monitoring endpoints explaining they are the **OFFICIAL** way to handle stuck campaigns:

```typescript
/**
 * GET /api/v201/monitoring/campaigns/stuck
 * Find campaigns that are stuck and should have been processed
 *
 * NOTE: This is the OFFICIAL way to handle stuck campaigns.
 * All campaign edge cases should be handled through this event-based monitoring system,
 * not through startup cleanup scripts. This ensures:
 * - Proper event flow with idempotency guarantees
 * - Consistent error handling and logging
 * - Audit trail through campaign logs
 * - No race conditions with BullMQ workers
 */
async getStuckCampaigns(req: Request, res: Response) { ... }

/**
 * POST /api/v201/monitoring/campaigns/stuck/process
 * Manually process stuck campaigns
 *
 * NOTE: This is the OFFICIAL way to process stuck campaigns.
 * This endpoint:
 * - Uses the same event-based flow as normal campaign processing
 * - Respects all idempotency checks
 * - Integrates with BullMQ job queue
 * - Provides detailed processing results
 * - Creates proper audit logs
 */
async processStuckCampaigns(req: Request, res: Response) { ... }
```

### 3. **src/@types/custom.d.ts** - Fixed TypeScript Errors

Added global type declaration for `adminAddress` to fix TypeScript errors:

```typescript
// Extend globalThis to include custom properties
declare global {
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-var
  var adminAddress: string[];
}
```

**Fixes:**
- ❌ Before: `Element implicitly has an 'any' type because type 'typeof globalThis' has no index signature`
- ✅ After: Properly typed global variable

## How to Handle Stuck Campaigns Now

### Option 1: Via Admin Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Navigate to **Admin Dashboard → Monitoring Tab**
2. View stuck campaigns in real-time
3. Click **"Process Stuck Campaigns"** button
4. Review processing results and logs

### Option 2: Via API Endpoints

```bash
# View stuck campaigns
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/v201/monitoring/campaigns/stuck \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Process stuck campaigns
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v201/monitoring/campaigns/stuck/process \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Processed 3 campaigns, 0 failed",
  "data": {
    "processed": 3,
    "failed": 0,
    "details": [
      {
        "campaignId": "123456789",
        "status": "success"
      }
    ]
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Benefits of Event-Based Approach

### 1. **Idempotency Guarantees**
- Database-backed checks prevent duplicate processing
- Safe to retry failed operations
- No risk of double reward distribution

### 2. **Proper Event Flow**
- All campaign operations trigger correct events
- Events processed by BullMQ workers with concurrency=1
- Sequential processing prevents race conditions

### 3. **Audit Trail**
- Every operation logged in `campaign_logs` table
- Full visibility into campaign lifecycle
- Easy debugging and monitoring

### 4. **Consistent Error Handling**
- Errors captured in dead letter queue
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

### 5. **Better Performance**
- Server starts faster (no startup queries)
- Processing happens asynchronously
- Admin can monitor and control operations

## Migration Notes

### For Developers

**Before (Deprecated):**
```typescript
// ❌ Don't do this anymore
await completeCampaignOperation(campaign);
```

**After (Correct):**
```typescript
// ✅ Use monitoring endpoints
const response = await fetch('/api/v201/monitoring/campaigns/stuck/process', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

### For Admins

- No manual intervention needed during server startup
- Use Admin Dashboard → Monitoring Tab to handle stuck campaigns
- Processing is now on-demand and controllable
- Full audit trail for all operations

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Code:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   pm2 restart hashbuzz-backend
   ```

2. **Verify Startup:**
   ```bash
   # Check logs - should see "Server is running" without stuck campaign processing
   pm2 logs hashbuzz-backend --lines 50
   ```

3. **Check Monitoring:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4000/api/v201/monitoring/campaigns/stuck
   ```

4. **Process Any Stuck Campaigns:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v201/monitoring/campaigns/stuck/process
   ```

---

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- **Startup Time:** Should be faster without database queries
- **Stuck Campaigns:** Monitor via `/api/v201/monitoring/campaigns/stuck`
- **Processing Success Rate:** Track via campaign logs
- **Event Queue Health:** Monitor BullMQ dashboard

### Alerts to Set Up

- Alert if stuck campaigns > 5
- Alert if processing success rate < 95%
- Alert if server startup time > 10 seconds

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the old code is preserved in git history:

```bash
# View removed code
git show HEAD~1:src/index.ts | grep -A 40 "One-time cleanup"

# Rollback (not recommended)
git revert HEAD
```

**Note:** Rollback is NOT recommended. The event-based approach is superior in every way. If issues occur, fix them in the monitoring endpoints, not by reverting to startup cleanup.

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Legacy cleanup code successfully removed**
✅ **All edge cases handled through event-based monitoring system**
✅ **TypeScript errors fixed**
✅ **Proper documentation added**
✅ **Admin dashboard integration complete**

The system is now fully event-driven with proper idempotency guarantees, audit trails, and monitoring capabilities.
